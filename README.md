## üåê Overview

FINGERPRINTER is a web application designed to raise user awareness and fortify online identities against tracking techniques. The dashboard allows users to explore their browser's unique digital profile with ease.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Explore the FINGERPRINTER dashboard [in your web browser](https://gonzosint.github.io/fingerprinter).

## üîÑ Compare Fingerprints

Evaluate your browser's privacy level by checking if the identifier changes each time you open the browser, after clearing data, or in incognito mode. 

If you consistently get a **unique identifier each time (üü¢)**, it's a positive indicator for privacy. However, if the **identifier remains constant (üî¥)**, it's a potential risk to your privacy, making you more easily trackable.

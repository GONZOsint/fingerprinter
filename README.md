# 🕵️‍♂️ FINGERPRINTER

## 🌐 Overview

FINGERPRINTER is a web application designed to raise user awareness and fortify online identities against tracking techniques. The dashboard allows users to explore their browser's unique digital profile with ease.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Explore the FINGERPRINTER dashboard [in your web browser](https://gonzosint.github.io/fingerprinter).

## 🔄 Compare Fingerprints

Evaluate your browser's privacy level by checking if the identifier changes each time you open the browser, after clearing data, or in incognito mode. 

If you consistently get a **unique identifier each time (🟢)**, it's a positive indicator for privacy. However, if the **identifier remains constant (🔴)**, it's a potential risk to your privacy, making you more easily trackable.

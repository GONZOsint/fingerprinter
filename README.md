## üåê Overview

**FINGERPRINTER** is a web application designed to raise user awareness and fortify online identities against tracking techniques. The dashboard allows users to explore their browser's unique digital profile with ease. With a comprehensive set of fingerprinting identifiers and the **Cross Browser ID** feature, FINGERPRINTER provides an in-depth analysis of your online footprint across different browsers.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Explore the FINGERPRINTER dashboard [online](https://gonzosint.github.io/fingerprinter).

## üîÑ Compare Fingerprints

Evaluate your browser's privacy level by checking if the identifier changes under different conditions:

- **Each time you open the browser**
- **After clearing data**
- **In incognito mode**
- **In other browser**

**Indicators:**

- üü¢ **Unique Identifier Each Time:** Indicates a higher level of privacy, making tracking more difficult.
- üî¥ **Consistent Identifier:** Suggests a lower privacy level, increasing the risk of being tracked.

## üîç Unique Identifiers

FINGERPRINTER utilizes a variety of fingerprinting libraries to generate unique identifiers. These identifiers help assess how easily your browser can be tracked across different sessions and environments. Below is a unified list of all integrated fingerprinting methods:

- [ThumbmarkJS](https://thumbmarkjs.com/)
- [FingerprintJS](https://github.com/fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs)
- [ClientJS](https://clientjs.org/)
- [ImprintJS](https://github.com/mattbrailsford/imprintjs)
- [DetectIncognitoJS](https://github.com/Joe12387/detectIncognito)
- [OPFS Fingerprinting Script](https://github.com/Joe12387/OP-Fingerprinting-Script)
- [CanvasprintJS](https://github.com/rylans/canvasprintjs)
- [BrowserSignature](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/browser-signature)
- [CUID](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/browser-fingerprint)
- [GhostIP](https://github.com/GONZOsint/fingerprinter/blob/main/static/ghostip.js) 
- [GhostDeviceInfo](https://github.com/GONZOsint/fingerprinter/blob/main/static/ghostdevice.js) 
- [get-browser-fingerprint](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/get-browser-fingerprint) 

Each of these identifiers employs different techniques to capture unique aspects of your browser and device, contributing to a comprehensive fingerprint profile.

## üß© Cross Browser ID

**Cross Browser ID** is a feature that consolidates fingerprint data from multiple browsers to generate a unified identifier. This allows users to understand how consistent their digital fingerprint is across different browsers, enhancing privacy insights.

**How It Works:**

1. **Data Collection:** FINGERPRINTER collects just hardware data using various techniques.
2. **Consolidation:** The collected information is processed to generate a **Cross Browser ID**.
3. **Analysis:** Users can compare this ID to assess the consistency and uniqueness of their fingerprints across browsers.

**Benefits:**

- **Enhanced Privacy Insights:** Understand the uniformity of your online identity across multiple browsers.
- **Tracking Resistance:** Identify discrepancies that might aid in tracking your online activities.

## IP Data

FINGERPRINTER uses the [ipdata](https://ipdata.co/) service to retrieve information about the user's IP address, providing additional context to enhance the digital profile. This includes details such as:

- **IP Address**
- **Country**
- **Region**
- **City**
